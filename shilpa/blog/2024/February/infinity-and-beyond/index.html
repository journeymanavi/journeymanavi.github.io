            An unforgettable bicycle trip across the surreal landscapes of
            Kutch. Covering 300 km over 4 days. With the support of a tribe
            like no other. <br />
            This is the story of how I pedalled my way from nervous anxiety to
            everlasting memories. And from self doubt to self liberation.

          <h2>Preparation</h2>
          <p>
            I enrolled for this ride on one of my friend's suggestion, who had
            done it last year. I needed a goal to start cycling again. It was
            the very first time for me to go on a solo trip and with all
            unknown people. Lots of anxiety - Cycling in Kutch for 300 km in 4
            days seemed a lot considering my little practice, managing things
            at home while I am away, worried about the extreme weather in the
            desert with cold mornings and really hot days.
          </p>

          <p>
            The enrollment forced me to start practising every weekend or
            every long weekend that came, slowly increasing my stamina and
            riding from 10km to 20km to 50km. As the dates got closer,
            suddenly the tiredness of driving back from office vanished and I
            went cycling even in the evening when I got 30mins time to myself.
            The preparation didn't seem enough but I think I made the most out
            of the time I had.
          </p>

          <p>
            Making sure the cycle was serviced and fitted well for the ride
            was one of the top priorities. Got that done first.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first meeting with the Speaking Wheels team made me a bit
            comfortable, at least having a face to the names slowed my mind
            from making wild guesses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then followed rounds of shopping for all cycling gears. Multiple
            visits to decathlon and nearby sports stores slowly closed my
            list.
          </p>

          <p>
            The day when we had to deliver cycles to be packed and sent to
            Bhuj, made me realized that this was happening for real. My
            beloved cycle was dismantled and packed carefully for her long
            journey till Bhuj in a tempo. Met the Speaking wheel group second
            time, making me feel a bit less nervous.
          </p>

          <p>
            We all decided to hire a tempo traveler and set out for Mumbai
            together, which was another opportunity to get to know people
            before the ride began.
          </p>

          <p>
            Everyone in the group was part of the Speaking Wheels tribe for a
            long time and there were only a couple of us who were outsiders
            and only me who was going with them for the first time. In spite
            of this strangeness no one let me feel that way, everyone was
            friendly and included me in their discussions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The overnight train ride was comfortable and in the morning we all
            regrouped in one compartment to continue with the fun
            conversations.

            Bhuj, Bike Check and Local Sight Seeing
          </h2>
          <p>
            We reached Bhuj around noon. By this time I was far more
            comfortable with the team than my first day. We all cramped up in
            a <em>tum-tum</em> with a lot of luggage, all literally squeezing
            in, headed to the Hotel.
          </p>
          <p>
            On entering the hotel, the first thing we saw was our cycles
            already in place, assembled and lined up. The feeling of riding
            through this interesting terrain of Kutch started sinking in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course a Gujarti thali lunch was a must in Gujarat. With so
            many delicacies on the plate, everyone got more than something
            they liked. After a hearty lunch the plan was to ride around Bhuj,
            a small ride, to ensure that our cycles are ready for the coming
            days. A local cycle mechanic came in and ensured that the cycles
            were refitted correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bhuj is a small place with narrow, crowded roads with rickshaws,
            cattle, vendors and dust. Bhuj Praj Mahal was a beautiful ancient
            monument, with everything a palace has, great Italian Gothic
            architecture (surprisingly), huge durbars, carving, painting and a
            story to tell.
          </p>
          <p>
            On our way back we got lucky to time the sunset with the Hamisar
            Lake. The sunset by the water and with our cycles was a pleasure.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's being in Kutch without tasting the well known Kutchi
            Dabeli, so the dinner had us salivating on it. The day ended well
            with a briefing from our lead about the next day.

            Fossil Park and Layaari
          </h2>
          <p>
            Speaking wheel riding days always start on time with a good warmup
            session, so that we are mentally and physically fit to start
            riding. At dawn, all bags were out, placed in the tempo and the
            riders prepped up on their cycle with head and tail lights
            blinking. We started off from Bhuj towards Nirona.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a day of moderately difficult routine with a lot of stops.
            Moving out of the city on the highway, we saw farms of castor,
            mustard, pomegranate and cotton along the way. At first we stopped
            at Rudramata dam. The picturesque sunrise with beautifully painted
            sky and a hot cup of chai made a wonderful start.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we rode off to Nirona stopping on the way for a scrumptious
            breakfast in a traditional <em>dhaba</em>. Nirona had 2 very
            unique local art forms - Rogan Art (painting made from castor oil
            and color pigments) and copper bells. After learning more about
            these art forms and some satisfying shopping we headed off to
            Fossil park.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fossil park was a lovely place in the middle of nowhere. Small
            circular rooms gave us the first feeling of Bhungas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Evening we had a “Toofan” ride to Layaari, beautiful stone
            formations due to water streams. The river bed was dry but the
            wonders of water made natural transformations in the stones and
            they looked like a miniature version of grand canyon.
          </p>
          <p>
            On return we saw the fossil museum with fossils as old as a
            hundred million years. There were fossils of plants, corals and
            even dinosaurs. This told us about the long history as well as the
            diverse terrain of Kutch. Following it was a quiet sunset with
            peacocks freely roaming around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Local <em>Kadhi Kichadi</em>. dinner satisfyingly ended our day.

            Riding through Chhari towards White Desert of Rann
          </h2>
          <p>
            Today was the most important and exciting day of our ride. We were
            ready to ride in the barren desert of Chaari. The most unique
            experience one can ever have.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started by at dawn toggling the local village life, beautiful
            cattle then slowly entering the desert. The loose sand made it
            impossible to pedal on, so we had to carry the cycles by hand and
            we hopped onto them at the first opportunity we got. The desert
            started with little thorny shrubs around. Sand had settled on the
            roads originally covered by gravel. Occasionally there were bare
            patches of gravel rattling our bones. We kept making our way
            through it to slowly realize that we had reached in the middle of
            nowhere. Then on that parched cracked dry land, we were greeted
            with our tempo. An elaborate breakfast was neatly laid out on a
            table. This unforgettable moment can't be recreated in any
            different setting. The sun was hot the sand was loose but the
            spirits were so high that nothing mattered. After lots of fun,
            pictures and tummies full we started off again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this slowest desert stretch of 25km we saw a flock of
            vultures, a caravan of camels and bird feet on sandy roads. A lone
            truck passed by creating a dust cloud along the trail and making
            us realize that even a motorized vehicle has its challenges moving
            through this terrain. The few local surprised motorcyclists in
            this barren patch wondered what our group was upto and some even
            stopped to enquire. Even if it was hard to cycle, this part of the
            ride was indeed the most unique and unforgettable experience of my
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving back on tar road was a mixed feeling. The sun started to
            act on and we looking forward to the lunch pedalled towards Hodka.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lunch was simple but a most common Gujarati dish of thepla,
            achar and dahi. Not wasting a lot of time we soon headed towards
            our next destination Goriwali home stay in Bhungas. Amidst the
            tired legs and the temperature rising a welcoming drink of
            lemonade freshed us up. Everyone was looking forward to another
            exciting part of the day, the visit to White Rann of Kutch.
            Everyone got freshened up and dressed up in beautiful bright
            coloured clothes for the sunset at Rann. Our dear tempo took us
            from our home-stay to Dhordo. Standing in a wobbling tempo and
            passing through a desert made me feel as if I was refugee trying
            to migrate illegally.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Rann Utsav was a happening place with lots of tents, shops,
            event stages and finally food stalls. It's never is a bad time for
            <em>chaat</em>, so after quickly grabbing some spicy chaat we
            headed to the Rann in a camel cart. The beautifully decorated
            camels and the musical ghungaroos on them made us enjoy the ride.
            The Rann - a vast expanse of salt desert, an unbelievable sight.
            Everything as far as your eyes could see was white salt. There is
            nothing between you and the horizon except this white salt. The
            sky was beautiful, the people were colorful a lot of chatter
            around but still felt peaceful. The most amazing sunset brought
            all colors of the rainbow in the sky at the same time in a 360
            view. A place definitely worth visiting.
          </p>
          <p>
            The day ended with the most important activity of cleaning our
            cycles to ensure the sand was off the gears and cogs to have a
            smooth ride tomorrow. The campfire and singing around it made the
            night warmer and calmer.

            <br />
            The Day of the 100
          </h2>
          <p>
            Today we started on time to make the most of the morning cool.
            Passing back through Dhordo, Rann gates we took a turn to the
            infinity road. The road that went straight till infinity and
            beyond. This road was one of its kind- a smooth, well-marked,
            straight road with desert on both sides going till the horizon.
            Here I realized why this ride was named "Infinity and beyond".
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone took up their own pace and pedalled to happiness in their
            own rhythm and zone. It felt like I was almost meditating. There
            was no rush to pedal, there was not a lot of traffic and there was
            nothing around, just you, your cycle and the road reaching the
            infinity. As the road ended all of us had the same feeling that it
            should have been longer.
          </p>
          <p>
            We stopped for a packed breakfast at a local dhaba. Set off soon
            to our next target of India Bridge. India Bridge was the last
            bridge before the Pakistani border.
          </p>
          <p>
            The road was long, hot and a busy highway. Graceful herds of cows
            kept crossing us. Little local kids dressed in kaftans gave us the
            most innocent smiles. A little clap on their hands or a simple
            "Bye" brought immense happiness to them. I wondered what they
            thought. Maybe they were just astonished to see people cycling on
            the highway or maybe they wished they had cycles to ride on to
            school.
          </p>
          <p>
            The India Bridge was an Indian military border out post. Seeing
            those army soldiers made us feel grateful for their selfless
            service.
          </p>
          <p>
            The return journey was tiresome with the sun right on top and the
            headwinds slowing us with every passing truck.
          </p>
          <p>
            We kept pedalling and few of us pedalled even more to complete my
            our first ever 100km on a cycle. The cheering and enthusiastic
            appreciation from the tribe made it worth all the effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a long day we did some good round of stretching. This
            followed a round table conversation, play time and fun filled
            activities with everyone. We got to know more about each other as
            every one told their life journey. Every journey was unique and
            learnt a lot from it - little acts of kindness matter, follow your
            passion, fight all odds, preserve yourself, get over bullying,
            learn from your mistakes and many more.
          </p>
          <p>Those stories and people made a permanent place in my heart.</p>

            An end, a Beginning and Liberation!
          </h2>
          <p>
            The last day was here already. As done so far, we were ready
            before time - bags out, cycles ready and the final clicks done.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started cycling back on the Bhuj highway. The destination was
            closer and the experience was about to end. Everyone was riding to
            enjoy today.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was confident that today nothing can go wrong and I will make it
            till the finish. My anxieties had been converted to memories and I
            had a fulfilling feeling. A great satisfaction that I made the
            choice to come on this trip in spite of all fears. I felt grateful
            for everyone back home, who let me be carefree 'me' for these 5
            days, without worrying about work, home or kids.
          </p>
          <p>
            I felt liberated. These 5 days were days full of learning and
            without any judgments. I wasn't a mother or a wife or a daughter
            or anyone, I was just being ME.
          </p>
          <p>The ride came to an end at Bhuj and so did my journey.</p>
          <p>
            What's with a group of ladies if we don't go shopping. So in the
            little time we got we hurried back, got ready all packed up and
            went shopping. Shopping for local clothes, food and even managed
            to get a toy for my son!
          </p>
          <p>
            The train journey back was a reflection time. Again filled with
            lots of laughter, remembering our time together and knowing each
            other even better.
          </p>
          <p>
            At dawn as the train entered Bandra station I was struck with the
            most pleasant surprise - my family waiting for me holding a
            “Welcome Home Mumma” poster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some memories are created for lifetime and this definitely made it
            to be one of the top ones.
          </p>
          <p>Hoping to have lots more like this in the future.</p>
