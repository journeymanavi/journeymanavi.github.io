              An unforgettable bicycle trip across the surreal landscapes of
              Kutch. Covering 300 km over 4 days. With the support of a tribe
              like no other. This is the story of how I pedalled my way from
              anxiety to memories and from fear to liberation.

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>
              I enrolled for this ride on one of my friend's suggestion, who had
              done this last year. I needed a goal to start cycling again. It
              was the very first time for me to go on a solo trip and with all
              unknown people. Lots of anxiety. Cycling in Kutch for 300 km in 4
              days seemed a lot considering my little practice. Managing things
              at home while I am away. Worried about the extreme weather in the
              desert with cold mornings and really hot days.
            </p>

            <p>
              The enrollment forced me to start practising every weekend or
              every long weekend that came, slowly increasing my stamina and
              riding from 10 km to 20 km to 50 km. As the dates got closer,
              suddenly the tiredness of driving back from the office vanished
              and I went cycling even in the evening even if I had 30 mins time
              to myself. The preparation didn't seem enough but I think I made
              the most out of the time I had.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first meeting with the Speaking Wheels team made me a bit
              comfortable, atleast having a face to the names slowed my mind
              from making wild guesses.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then followed the round of shopping for all cycling gears.
              Multiple rounds to decathlon and nearby sports stores slowly
              closed my list.
            </p>

            <p>
              Making sure the cycle was serviced and fitted well for the ride
              was one of the top priorities.
            </p>

            <p>
              The day when we had to deliver cycles to be packed and sent to
              Bhuj, made me realised that this was happening for real. My
              beloved cycle was dismantled and packed carefully for her long
              ride till Bhuj in a tempo. Again the second meeting with the
              Speaking wheel members made me feel a bit less nervous.
            </p>

            <p>
              We all decided to hire a tempo traveller and set out for Mumbai
              together, which was another opportunity to get to know people
              before the ride began.
            </p>

            <p>
              Everyone in the group was part of the Speaking Wheels tribe for a
              long time and there were only a couple of us who were outsiders
              and only me who was going with them for the first time. Inspite of
              this strangeness no one let me feel that way, everyone was
              friendly and included me in their discussions.
            </p>

            <p>
              The overnight train ride was comfortable and in the morning we all
              regrouped in one compartment to continue with the fun
              conversations.

              <br />
              Bhuj, Bike Check and Local Sight Seeing (15km)
            </h2>
            <p>
              We reached Bhuj around noon. By this time I was far more
              comfortable with the team than my first day. We all cramped up in
              a tumtum with a lot of luggage, all literally squeezing in headed
              to the Hotel.
            </p>
            <p>
              On entering the hotel, the first sight was of our cycles already
              in place, assembled and lined up. The feeling of riding through
              this interesting terrain of Kutch starting sinking in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course a Gujarthi thali lunch was a must in Gujarat. With so
              many delicacies on the plate, everyone got more than something
              they liked. After a hearty lunch the plan was to ride around Bhuj,
              a small ride, to ensure that our cycles are ready for the coming
              days. A local cycle mechanic came in and ensured that the cycles
              were refitted correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bhuj is a small place with narrow, crowded roads with rickshaws,
              cattles, vendors and dust. Bhuj Praj Mahal was a beautiful ancient
              monument, with everything a palace has, great Italian Gothic
              architecture (surprisingly), huge durbars, carving, painting and a
              story to tell.
            </p>
            <p>
              On our way back we got lucky to time the sunset with the Hamisar
              Lake. The sunset by the water and with our cycles was a pleasure.
            </p>
            <p>
              What's being in Kutch without tasting the well known Kutchi
              Dabeli, so the dinner had us salivating on it. The day ended well
              with a briefing from our lead about the next day.

            </h2>
            <p>
              Speaking wheel riding days start always on time with a good warmup
              session, so that we are mentally and physically fit to start
              riding. At dawn before the sunrise, all bags were out, placed in
              the tempo and the riders prepped up on their cycle with head and
              tail lights blinking. We started off from Bhuj towards Nirona.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a day of moderately difficult routine with a lot of stops.
              Moving out of the city on the road there were farms of castor,
              mustard, pomegranate and cotton. At first we stopped at Rudramata
              dam. The picturesque sunrise with beautifully painted sky and a
              hot cup of chai made a wonderful start.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then we rode off to Nirona stopping on the way for a scrumptious
              breakfast in a traditional dhaba. Nirona had 2 very unique local
              art forms - Rogan Art ( painting made from castor oil and colour
              pigments) and copper bells. After learning more about these art
              forms and some satisfying shopping we headed off to Fossil park.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a lovely place in the middle of nowhere. Small circular
              rooms gave us the first feeling of Bhungas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Evening we had a “Toofan” ride to Layaari, beautiful stone
              formations due to water streams. The river bed was dry but the
              wonders of water made natural transformations in the stones and
              they looked like a miniature version of grand canyon.
            </p>
            <p>
              On return we saw a very unique fossil collection with fossils as
              old as a hundred million years. There were fossils of plants,
              coral and even a dinosaur egg. This told us about the long history
              as well as the diverse terrain of Kutch. It was a quiet sunset
              with peacocks freely roaming.
            </p>
            <p>Local Kadhi Kichadi dinner satisfyingly ended our day.</p>

              Day 3, 10th Feb 2024
              <br />
              Chaari Desert (70km)
            </h2>
            <p>
              Today was the most important day of our ride as told at the
              beginning. We were ready to ride in the barren desert of Chaari.
              The most unique experience one can ever have.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started by toggling the local village life, beautiful cattle
              then slowly entering the desert. The loose sand made it impossible
              to pedal on, so we had to carry the cycles by hand and we hopped
              onto them at the first opportunity we got. The desert started with
              little thorny shrubs around… sand had settled on the roads
              originally covered by gravel. Occasionally there were bare patches
              of gravel rattling our bones. When We kept making our way through
              it to slowly realise that we had reached in the middle of
              nowhere…on those cracked dry land, we were greeted with our
              tempo…and then soon we had an elaborate breakfast neatly laid out
              on a table. This unforgettable moment can't be recreated in any
              different setting. The sun was hot the sand was loose but the
              spirits were so high that nothing mattered…after lots of fun
              pictures and tummies full we started off again.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along this slowest stretch of 25km desert patch we saw a flock of
              vultures, a caravan of camels and surprised motorcyclists
              wondering what we were doing in the middle of the desert. A lone
              truck passed by creating a dust cloud along the trail and making
              us realise that even a motorised vehicle has its challenges moving
              through this terrain. The few vehicles in this barren patch
              wondered what our group was upto and some even stopped to enquire.
              Even if it was hard to cycle, this part of the ride was indeed the
              most unique and unforgettable experience of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving back on tar road was a mixed feeling. The sun started to
              act on and we looking forward to the lunch pedalled towards Hodka.
            </p>
            <p>
              The lunch was simple but a most common gujrati dish of thepla,
              achar and dahi. Not wasting a lot of time we soon headed towards
              our next destination Goriwali home stay. Amidst the tired legs and
              the temperature rising a welcoming drink of lemonade freshed us
              up. Everyone was looking forward to another exciting part of the
              trip, the visit to Rann of Kutch. Everyone got freshened up and
              dressed up in beautiful bright coloured clothes for the sunset at
              Rann. Our beloved tempo took us from our homestay to Dhordo.
              Standing in a wobbling tempo and passing through a desert made me
              feel as if we were refugees trying to migrate illegally.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Rann Utsav was a happening place with lots of tents, shops,
              event stages and finally food stalls. It's never a bad time for
              chat, so after quickly grabbing some spicy chat we headed to the
              Rann in a camel cart. The beautifully decorated camels and the
              musical ghungaroos on them made us enjoy the ride. The Rann a vast
              expanse of salt desert, an unbelievable sight. Everything as far
              as your eyes could see was white salt…there is nothing between you
              and the horizon except this white salt. The sky was beautiful, the
              people were colourful a lot of chatter but still felt peaceful.
              The most amazing sunset brought all colours of the rainbow in the
              sky at the same time. A place definitely worth visiting.
            </p>
            <p>
              The day ended with the most important activity of cleaning our
              cycles to ensure the sand was off the gears and cogs to have a
              smooth ride tomorrow. The campfire and singing around it made the
              night calmer and warmer.

              <br />
              The Day of the 100 (100km)
            </h2>
            <p>
              We started on time to make the most of the morning cool. Passing
              back through Dhordo, Rann gates we took a turn to the infinity
              road. The road that went straight till infinity and beyond. This
              road was one of its kind…a smooth, wellmarked, straight road with
              desert on both sides going till the horizon. Here I realised why
              this ride was named infinity and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone took up their own pace and pedalled to happiness in their
              own rhythm and zone. It felt like I was almost meditating. There
              was no rush to pedal, there was not a lot of traffic and there was
              nothing around, just you, your cycle and the road reaching the
              inifinity. As the road ended all of us had the same feeling that
              it should have been longer.
            </p>
            <p>
              We stopped for a packed breakfast at a local dhaba. Set off soon
              to our next target of India Bridge. India Bridge was the last
              bridge before the Pakistani border.
            </p>
            <p>
              The road was long, hot and a busy highway. The music playing made
              me pedal on the rhythm. Graceful herds of cows kept crossing us.
              Little local kids dressed in kaftans gave us the most innocent
              smiles and a little clap on their hands or a simple bye brought
              immense happiness to them. I wondered what they thought. Maybe
              they were just astonished to see people cycling on the highway or
              maybe they wished they had cycles to ride on to school.
            </p>
            <p>
              The India Bridge was a military border out post. Seeing those army
              soldiers made us feel grateful for their selfless service.
            </p>
            <p>
              The return journey was tiresome with the sun right on top and the
              headwinds slowing us with every passing truck.
            </p>
            <p>
              We kept pedalling and I pedalled even more to complete my first
              ever 100km on a cycle. The cheering and enthusiastic appreciation
              from the tribe made it worth all the effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a long day we did some good round of stretching. This
              followed a round table discussion, play time and fun filled
              activities with everyone. We got to know more about each one of us
              as every one told their life journey. Every journey was unique and
              learnt a lot from it - little acts of kindness matter, follow your
              passion, fight all odds, preserve yourself, get over bullying,
              learn from your mistakes to grow and many more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those stories and people have made a permanent place in my heart.

              Day 5, 12th Feb 2024
              <br />
              An end, a Beginning and Liberation! (50km)
            </h2>
            <p>
              The last day was here already. As done so far, we were ready
              before time… bags out, cycles ready and the final clicks done.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started cycling back on the Bhuj highway. The destination was
              closer and the experience was about to end. Everyone was riding to
              enjoy today.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was confident that today nothing can go wrong and I will make it
              till the finish. My anxieties had been converted to memories and I
              had a fulfilling feeling. A great satisfaction that I made the
              choice to come on this trip in spite of all fears. I felt grateful
              for everyone back home, who let me be carefree 'me' for these 5
              days, without worrying about work, home or kids.
            </p>
            <p>
              I felt liberated. These 5 days were days full of learning and
              without any judgments. I wasn't a mother or a wife or a daughter
              or anyone… I was just being ME.
            </p>
            <p>The ride came to an end at Bhuj and so did my journey.</p>
            <p>
              What's with a group of ladies if we don't go shopping. So in the
              little time we got we hurried back, got ready all packed up and
              went shopping. Shopping for local clothes, food and even managed
              to get a toy for my son!
            </p>
            <p>
              The train journey was a reflection time. Again filled with lots of
              laughter remembering our time together and knowing each other even
              better.
            </p>
            <p>
              At dawn as the train entered Bandra station I was struck with the
              most pleasant surprise to see my family waiting for me holding a
              “Welcome home mumma” poster.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some memories are created for lifetime and this definitely made it
              to be one of the top ones.
            </p>
            <p>Hoping to have lots more in the future.</p>
